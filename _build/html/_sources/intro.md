# Prediction of Response Spectra Using Machine Learning Techniques. An AI-Driven Approach to Seismic Engineering

 Engineering, in general, seeks to provide solutions to everyday problems,
 risks, and needs. Within this broad scope, Seismic Engineering plays a crucial
 role in addressing natural hazards such as seismic events and earthquakes. Year
 after year, seismologists and civil engineers strive to anticipate the potential
 damages caused by such events, with one of the most critical challenges being
 the prediction of the seismic response spectra.
 Traditional Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs) have long served
 as the standard physics-based approach for estimating ground shaking intensity.
 However, these models face a fundamental limitation: they rely heavily on his
torical records, which are scarce for rare, high-magnitude earthquakes. This
 data scarcity restricts their ability to provide reliable predictions in extrapola
tive scenarios, precisely where accurate forecasting is most needed.
 Predicting response spectra with accuracy and physical consistency would
 open new possibilities for earthquake preparedness and risk mitigation. The
 central challenge, therefore, is not only the limited availability of seismic data
 but also the need for models capable of going beyond interpolation, achieving
 extrapolation guided by physical principles. In this context, Machine Learning
 emerges as a promising alternative. Yet, it is crucial to identify and develop
 ML models that not only provide accurate predictions but also retain physical
 meaning, ensuring that extrapolation aligns with established seismic theory.
